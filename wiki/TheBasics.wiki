#summary Downloading The Latest Source/Version
= Geting Started (MAC/WIN) =
Execute the Following Commands: ([USERNAME] is your Google Code Username & [OSNAME] is either: MAC or WIN)
{{{
svn checkout https://hangoutslogsplus.googlecode.com/svn/[OSNAME] hangoutslogsplus --username [USERNAME]
}}}
== Step 2==
There should be a new file in your home directory:
On mac execute: 
{{{
open ~/mac/
}}}
On windows open the folder in your home folder:
{{{
~/WIN/
}}}
= Getting Started (LUNIX) =
It is well known that mac's terminal responds the same as Lunix's Terminal/GNU Bash! So MAC is really LUNIX/MAC!
So, Just Follow the Mac's Steps exactly!
=Updating (MAC/WIN/LUNIX)=
Well, there is no _need_ to check for updates, but you might repetitively use the Hangouts Logs and need to disable/enable them a lot. So updates are checked for by executing:
{{{
svn update
}}}
When it asks:
{{{
Updating '.':

 - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!

(R)eject, accept (t)emporarily or accept (p)ermanently?
}}}
Enter in response:
{{{
t
}}}
and press enter!

As a result,  if you set the OS, a new version file will be available!
==Errors==
There are about a million possible errors with svn up...
One very common one would be:
{{{
Repository UUID was not expected UUID
}}}
Do not fret, this means there is no new version!
